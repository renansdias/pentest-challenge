# Introduction

This tutorial will explain in details how to launch the base infrastructure that Slalom provided during the event so you can try to solve the challenge even if you didn't attend the event.

# TL;DR

Here's all steps you will need to perform in order to launch the base infrastructure:
 
1. Log in to your AWS account
2. Create a bucket for the Terraform state files (the name should be globally unique, but let's call it bucket-1 for the purpose of this tutorial)
3. Run a Docker command to launch the infra. Take a look at the **Step 2: Launching the base infrastructure** section.

# Step-By-Step

Here's a step by step so you can launch the base infrastructure:

## Step 0: Log in to your AWS account

If you don't have an AWS account, [create one first](https://aws.amazon.com/). If you do, log in now.

## Step 1: Create a bucket for Terraform state files

You will be using Terraform in a Docker container to launch the base infrastructure. Don't worry if you have never used Terraform before. A bash script will run all commands needed.
However, since Terraform keeps the state of the infrastructure in files, you don't want those files to be kept in a container that can die at any minute. Best practice is to keep the state files in a remote storage like S3.

[Follow these steps to create an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html). Name the bucket as you wish.

## Step 2: Accept the Terms and Conditions of the Kali Linux AMI

Before you can launch a Kali Linux instance on AWS, you need to accept Kali's terms and conditions. If you don't and you try to use Terraform, for example, to launch the instance, it will fail. Let's accept the terms and conditions first.

Head over to: [https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M26MMTT](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M26MMTT)

Then click on **Continue to Subscribe**:

Accept the Terms:

![Kali](./images/kali-tac-02.png)

After you accept, it may take a few seconds before you're subscribed to this product. You will see that the **Continue to Configuration** button is grayed out:

![Kali](./images/kali-tac-03.png)

After a few seconds/minutes, the **Continue to Configuration** button will become active. At that point, your account is subscribed to Kali Linux and you're ready to launch the base infrastructure:

## Step 3: Launch the base infrastructure

The Docker command that you will have to run will take two environment variables as input. Let's first discuss each one of them so you understand them before running `docker run`.

### TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET_NAME
The name of the bucket for the Terraform state files that you created in **Step 1**.

### WORKSTATION_IP
The IP address of your workstation so the Security Group of the instances is locked down to your IP and not open to the world.

The next thing you should understand is regarding how Terraform can make calls to the AWS API on your behalf. If you've used AWS enough, you know that users use an Access Key and a Secret Access Key to access the AWS API. These keys can be found in a file called `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

You should also configure region and output using `~/.aws/config`:

```
[default]
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

What you need to do is to somehow give Terraform access to these files. In Docker, that can be achieved by mouting a volume. So in order to mount the `.aws` folder in your home directory to the docker container, you can use the `-v` option.

Run the following command and replace <HOME-DIRECTORY> with the actual path of your home directory, <TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET_NAME> with the name of the bucket and <WORKSTATION_IP> with the IP address of your workstation (Beware that the syntax below is for Linux/Mac. If you're using Windows, the syntax might change slightly, like forward slash vs backslash):

```
docker run -it --rm \
    -v <HOME-DIRECTORY>/.aws/:/root/.aws \
    -e 'TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET_NAME=<TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET_NAME>' \
    -e 'WORKSTATION_IP=<WORKSTATION_IP>' \
    slalomdojo/ryod:pentest \
    ./deploy
```

The command above will use Terraform to launch the base infrastructure needed to solve the challenge. Once it's done, the script will output the IP address of both attacker and target machines and the private key that should be used to log into both machines. The output will look like the following:

```
*****************************************************
Attacker machine IP address(es)

YY.YY.YY.YY

-----------------------------------------------------

Target machine IP address

XX.XX.XX.XX

-----------------------------------------------------

Here is the Private Key you will use to SSH into
both Target and Attacker servers:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Save this private key in a file in your local machine
for later use.
*****************************************************
```

If you see the message "Something went wrong with Terraform. Take a look at the error above.", well, the messages says it all :)

Here are a few things to watch out for:
* Make sure you **subscribed to the Kali Linux AMI** (see *Step 2: Accept the Terms and Conditions of the Kali Linux AMI*).
* When you provide a Workstation IP address, use `/32` at the end (e.g. XX.XX.XX.XX/32).
* You might hit some limit in your account. If that happens, request a limit increase to AWS via the Support console.

Save the contents of the private key (from `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`) in a file. Then, log in to the attacker machine to start the challenge:

For Linux/Mac users:
```
ssh -i <PRIVATE-KEY-PATH> ec2-user@<ATTACKER-IP-ADDRESS>
```

[Windows users can use Putty](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/). Once you're in, you can skip the **Getting Started** section of the challenge. Start at **Task 1**.

# Cost

This is how much this base infrastructure will cost you **PER DAY** on AWS:
* Target machine (t2.micro): USD 0.28 / day
* Target machine EBS: USD 0.8 / day
* Attacker machine (t2.medium): USD 1.12 / day
* Attacker machine EBS: USD 2.50 / day

The majority of the prices above only applies to you if your AWS account **is not within the free tier period**. If your account is brand new, you will only pay for the Attacker machine. 

# Destroying the base infrastructure

Once you're done, run the same command you ran to deploy the infra, but specify `./destroy` instead of `./deploy`:

```
docker run -it --rm \
    -v <HOME-DIRECTORY>/.aws/:/root/.aws \
    -e 'TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET_NAME=<TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET_NAME>' \
    -e 'WORKSTATION_IP=<WORKSTATION_IP>' \
    slalomdojo/ryod:pentest \
    ./destroy
```
